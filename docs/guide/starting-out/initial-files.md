# Initial Files
This is gonna teaching you the initial files to start with.

# Users Starting-out
It would be recommended for Users starting out to just use a `main.py` file and put there `Cogs` in a `Cogs` folder.

# Advanced Users
For advanced users it would be recommended to have your bot split into modules,

Like `moderation_module` or `fun_module`, etc

it's also for these users were it's recommended to subclass `Bot` or `Client` instead of doing `=` to add more features.
